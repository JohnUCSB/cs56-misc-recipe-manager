1. This project is a recipe manager with a GUI. Its purpose is to allow the user to add, save, and review recipes.
2. As a user of this program, I can view the two preloaded recipes in the GUI window. I also have a number of options available to me in the File menu, including adding and deleting recipes, loading and saving recipe lists (these features seem to be broken), and searching.
3. The software does compile and run, as described in (B).  I can also import images from my computer into the recipes.
4. As a user, a feature I think would be really useful is a conversion table and claculator.  There could be a seperate button next to the file button that would bring up a usefule conversion table and a calculator attached to those conversions that prompts the user to enter one value and then the calculator does automatic conversion.  Another feature that could be added is a "recipe for how many" option.  This feature would allow you to type in the number of people eating the dish and then automatically multiply the ingredient amounts to feed large groups of people.
5. The current README.md contains very little information about the project itself. There is a large project history section that is blank. There is an extra # in the main title. Almost all of the content of the current README.md is describing the problems the previous developer was having with saving and loading data in this application.
6. The build.xml works for compiling and running but the test target does not work because there are not Junit test.  The Javadoc target has a lot of outdated links.  Overall it is functional though
7. Yes there are enough "issues" for this to be a 1000 point project.  There are reported errors with saving and loading recipes.  The search function was not properly implemented.  The format of the recipes needs to be improved.  The overall program could use some visual work.  
8. 
9. Most of the classes and methods make sense except 2 classes in particular.  The first is the IngredientsList because it is simply an ArrayList, there are not overiddden methods and seems like an uneccesary class.  The second file and the file that would require the most work is the RecipePanel.java.  The RecipePanel probably has about 80% of the code in it and it very confusing to follow.  It seems like that code could be broken down into more well defined classes.  That file also needs a lot better Javadoc comments to improve its readability.  The quick and speedy information I would let another programmer know is, the program has six classes.  The interface class which has the main inside of it.  The ingredientsList class which is basically an ArrayList for the ingredients.  The recipe class which is the big object that contains things like ingredients, name, and  description.  The recipeAdder class which is a frame that allows you to type in String values for a new recipe.  The recipeList class which is also similar to an ArrayList.  Finally, the RecipePanel class, this is the biggest file and contains most of the information about the buttons and text fields in the user display.
10. There is no test code at all implemented for this program.  There are oppurtunities to create tests for this project.
