1. This project is a recipe manager with a GUI. Its purpose is to allow the user to add, save, and review recipes.
2. As a user of this program, I can view the two preloaded recipes in the GUI window. I also have a number of options available to me in the File menu, including adding and deleting recipes, loading and saving recipe lists (these features seem to be broken), and searching.
3. The software does compile and run, as described in (B).  I can also import images from my computer into the recipes.
4. As a user, a feature I think would be really useful is a conversion table and claculator.  There could be a seperate button next to the file button that would bring up a usefule conversion table and a calculator attached to those conversions that prompts the user to enter one value and then the calculator does automatic conversion.  Another feature that could be added is a "recipe for how many" option.  This feature would allow you to type in the number of people eating the dish and then automatically multiply the ingredient amounts to feed large groups of people.
5. The current README.md contains very little information about the project itself. There is a large project history section that is blank. There is an extra # in the main title. Almost all of the content of the current README.md is describing the problems the previous developer was having with saving and loading data in this application.

7. Yes there are enough "issues" for this to be a 1000 point project.  There are reported errors with saving and loading recipes.  The search function was not properly implemented.  The format of the recipes needs to be improved.  The overall program could use some visual work.
