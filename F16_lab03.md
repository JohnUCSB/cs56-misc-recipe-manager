1. This project is a recipe manager with a GUI. Its purpose is to allow the user to add, save, and review recipes.
2. As a user of this program, I can view the two preloaded recipes in the GUI window. I also have a number of options available to me in the File menu, including adding and deleting recipes, loading and saving recipe lists (these features seem to be broken), and searching.
3. The software does compile and run, as described in (B). I can also import images from my computer into the recipes.

5. The current README.md contains very little information about the project itself. There is a large project history section that is blank. There is an extra # in the main title. Almost all of the content of the current README.md is describing the problems the previous developer was having with saving and loading data in this application.
